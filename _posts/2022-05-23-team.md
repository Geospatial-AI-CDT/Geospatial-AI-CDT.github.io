The development of this proposal is being led by a team of experienced academics from across the University. Together we bring the broad technical and managerial skillset required to develop the CDT proposal. We're supported by a wider team of academics from our own schools and beyond. 

Many of us in the leadership team and wider support team have experience of working on geospatial artificial intelligence projects together, as can be seen in the [projects showcase](/project).

The leadership team for the development of the proposal consists of:-
