As has been anticipated for some time now, UKRI have now announced the official [call](https://www.ukri.org/opportunity/ukri-centres-for-doctoral-training-in-artificial-intelligence/) for CDTs in AI (and also separately a call for more general EPSRC CDTs). We will be putting our Geospatial AI proposal into the UKRI AI call (subject to institutional support) as it feels like the highly interdisciplinary nature of Geospatial AI is a good fit to the call objectives. 

Like the previous round of CDTs, the call has two parts - an initial Expression of Interest, followed by a full proposal for the proposers that get through the EoI stage. We will now be focusing on winning institutional support (institutions are limited to two proposals max, so we expect there will be competition) and working on creating a polished EoI submission for the February deadline. Future posts will talk about our progress!
