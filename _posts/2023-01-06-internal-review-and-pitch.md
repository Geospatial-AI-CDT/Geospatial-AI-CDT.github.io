The final part of the internal process to win institutional support for our proposal was a 10-minute, 4-slide, pitch presentation and Q&A session. Our slides from the presentation are below (also in PDF format [here](/assets/documents/jan23-uos-pitch.pdf){:target="_blank"}). Obviously the numbers and people mentioned in this deck are only a snapshot based on current engagement and will change as we expand our consultation. The good news is that we passed this hurdle and have been given the go-ahead to submit a full EoI to UKRI in about 6 weeks time!
