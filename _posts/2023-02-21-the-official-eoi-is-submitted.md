# Summary

Building upon our unmatched multidisciplinary expertise in the cross-over of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Geospatial Applications we propose a new CDT in Geospatial Artificial Intelligence. The proposed centre will train and develop the next generation of experts in AI, Machine Learning (ML) and Geospatial Science (GS), addressing a clear international and industry need for experts with such skills.

Geospatial data is used by many sectors (e.g., Transport, Construction, Space, Agriculture and Maritime & Shipping) and numerous opportunities exist for AI and geospatial data experts in these sectors. Geospatial data and AI will be at the heart of future fundamental scientific discovery (e.g., in areas from ocean understanding through to space environment physics, where events can affect our natural world), and in applications in Environment (e.g., monitoring, risk assessment and prediction, policy making). Other areas also benefit from Geospatial AI: food & farming; defence; resilience; and population health; etc.

Graduates of our CDT will be future leaders and experts in AI and ML and GS, with a breadth of knowledge around individual expertise and an understanding of motivations and constraints that apply to use cases beyond their own. Our graduates will be empowered to work with/within a variety of organisations, from industry to research centres to NGOs. Our training embeds social and ethical responsibility and a deep appreciation of the importance of environmental sustainability that graduates will champion throughout their careers.

Our training programme is designed to adapt to students from a wide range of disciplines (archaeology, mathematics, social science, law, earth & ocean science, geography, GS, computer science, AI, and engineering). We will help them develop a unique and unrivalled mixed skillset that meets an identified need while supporting flexible work patterns, providing pastoral care, and ensuring all our activities are inclusive. The programme has been co-created with industry involvement shaping plans for taught components, cohort building, and the projects students will undertake. Students undertake a 4-year PhD, with assessed training components embedded throughout all years.

The CDT has four themes which cover the gamut from algorithms that work with data to making informed policy decisions: “Fundamental ML research”, “Applied ML research”, “GS and remote sensing applications”, and “Intelligent policy and decision making”. Individual students will specialise in a single theme but will be trained to understand and communicate at a technical level with people from all four themes. Students put this training into practice within Grand Challenge weeks co-organised with our partners. This aspect exactly highlights why a cohort-based approach is crucial for our CDT.

Research topics will be diverse, for example looking at how: gravitational waves can uncover the earliest moments of the Universe; how ML can be used to help detect, monitor and protect archaeological sites; how new products for monitoring vegetation can be developed with ML and space-based sensors; how AI can be used for mapping and understanding data acquired by autonomous platforms for conservation; how new fundamental ML approaches can be developed to deal with the volume of data and scarcity of labels; and how AI-generated insights might be used to inform and change fishing policy. All these examples have AI/ML and geospatial data at their core.

Our proposal leverages factors unique to the University of Southampton, where only we have a sufficient mass of supervisors across the full breadth of topics of the CDT, coupled with the co-location of strategic external partners who are nationally some of the biggest generators and consumers of Geospatial data. The CDT will allow new collaborations, open new opportunities, and allow us to unlock our potential for the benefit of our students, staff, partners and beyond.

# Objectives

The CDT in Geospatial AI will help fill an internationally recognised skills gap between geospatial science and AI and its periphery by:

1.	Establishing an internationally leading research-training environment that equips students with comprehensive technical skills in Artificial Intelligence and Geospatial Science, and the understanding and transferrable skills to be able to communicate and interact with a broad range of Geospatial AI experts, stakeholders, policymakers and the public;
2.	Creating a new national training centre drawing across outstanding research, research and training environments, and training expertise at the University of Southampton and our partners;
3.	Co-developing a cohesive and inclusive training programme with partners that addresses the skills gaps identified by stakeholders and the individual needs of students;
4.	Taking a cohort-based approach to training that recognises that individuals cannot be experts in every area, but by learning to communicate and work together they can address and solve problems and confront societal challenges;
5.	Ensuring cohesiveness of the full cohort (in and across years) by providing co-location in year 1, engaging all students in weekly Graduate Research Workshops, and provision of an annual conference and flagship Grand Challenge week;
6.	Providing a comprehensive programme of collaboration with industrial, government and NGO partners through both formal training and internships;

We will equip students from varied backgrounds with the skills to specialise in aspects of Geospatial AI whilst understanding the bigger picture & its implications. This will be achieved through:

1.	A new and bespoke training programme with assessed elements that consists of compulsory technical modules, a broad range of specialist technical training, workshops, grand challenges, conferences, internships & placements, peer-to-peer mentoring and transferrable skills training;
2.	Provision of a uniquely broad range of leading-edge research projects exploiting the expertise of over 50 potential academic supervisors in collaboration with external partners who provide real-world problems and directly engage with supervision of students;
3.	Creation of a cohesive cohort and career-long network of professional contacts;
4.	Nurturing the innovation, entrepreneurship, principles, and diverse perspectives needed to confront societal challenges of sustainability and inequality and meet evidenced UK science and industry needs;
5.	Instilling the capability of understanding motivations and constraints that apply to use cases beyond their own research;
6.	Embedding a culture and ethos of socially and ethically responsible innovation through training and project design & selection processes.
7.	Actively encouraging diversity in recruitment, supporting flexible work, and providing pastoral care with effectiveness transparently monitored throughout the CDT’s lifetime.

We will engage with industry, government and NGO partners across sectors, locations and scales by providing a vital national resource for interfacing with experts across all facets of Geospatial AI. We will provide:

1.	Flexible routes for engagement through provision of partial studentships (depending on organisation size), provision of data and facilities, and contributions to delivery of our training programme including internships/placements;
2.	Access to “strategic partner” status with higher contribution towards PhD supervision directly from the partner; 
3.	Opportunities for partners to offer research projects and suggest research directions they would find beneficial;
4.	Routes for industry and partners to have paid access to parts of the training programme for their staff;
5.	Opportunities for partners to propose and host our flagship Grand Challenge weeks;
6.	Mechanisms to simplify IP arrangements using standardised agreements dependent on the financial contribution of the partner.


# Outline Case for Support

*Global geospatial markets are expected to hit \>£100bn by 2028 with 12%
growth/yr<sup>1</sup>. Our analysis of doctoral training provision and
extensive consultation with industry identifies a major skills gap in
Geospatial AI. Our proposal fulfils this demand through
partner-co-developed training that nurtures responsible innovation,
entrepreneurship, and the diverse perspectives needed to confront
societal challenges of sustainability and inequality, meeting UK
science, industry, and government need<sup>1-7</sup>.*


## 1. Centre Vision
<img src="/assets/images/outline-cfs/image1.png"
style="width:3in; margin-left: 15px" align=right/> Geospatial AI is the use of AI and machine learning (ML) to efficiently
extract actionable information from geospatial data. We propose a
national training centre for the next generation of responsible
Geospatial AI innovators that is *co-created* with non-HEI partners *and
shaped* by their needs. Our CDT considers (i) how AI can improve
geospatial data analysis, and ii) how geospatial data can help answer
fundamental AI questions through the four illustrated themes. Although
independent training programmes for geospatial analysis and fundamental
AI exist, a joined-up training approach is both lacking and essential to
leverage the volume, value, and variety of geospatial data, understand
data synergies, bottlenecks and redundancies, and the implications on
policy and sustainability. We focus on supporting intelligent policy and
decisions; our cohorts investigate aspects of the AI-based pipeline from
geospatial data acquisition to generating actionable information &
insight, over a broad range of applications. Our graduates will be
future leaders in *AI, ML* and *Geospatial Science,* capable of
understanding motivations and constraints that apply beyond their own
use cases. They will *not* be experts in every facet of Geospatial AI,
but rather subject experts in parts of the pipeline & trained to also
understand the *big picture*; this can only be achieved with
cohort-based training. They will have the knowledge breadth and skills
to communicate effectively with a broad range of Geospatial AI experts,
stakeholders, and the public. Our recruitment encourages diverse student
backgrounds.

**Call Priorities:** We address EPSRC/NERC/STFC/ESRC/BBSRC/AHRC &
Innovate UK priorities. We focus on (i) “*science and research*”
(enabling new hypotheses, questions and data-driven research looking
both *in* towards Earth & *out* towards the atmosphere and space, with
applications in conservation, modelling, geo-political event monitoring,
exploration, space environment physics), and (ii) “*environment and
energy*” (cross-cutting environmental and risk modelling/prediction,
monitoring cause-effect loops between policy decisions and change). Our
partner remits include themes of defence (augmenting human decisions at
scale), understanding agriculture and transport supply chains, and
population-scale global health. We address the cross-cutting
“*government policy*” theme through training embedded responsible
innovation principles (e.g., how to inform policy with AI, while
generating awareness of data/method limitations and potential
consequences).

**National Need:** The 2020-25 Geospatial Strategy<sup>2</sup> estimates
a UK economic value of £11bn/yr, identifying AI as a key underpinning
technology. The Chancellor’s 2022 spring statement<sup>6</sup> and the
AI Roadmap<sup>7</sup> both recognise the need to train new AI experts,
prioritising “AI skill building”, “diversity and inclusion”, and
“achieving AI and data literacy for everyone”. Our proposal has been
shaped through engagement with UK and global industries and NGOs who
confirm the urgent need for Geospatial AI expertise and see the lack of
skilled people as an inhibitor. We will fulfil both national ambitions
and partner needs by training cohorts of AI experts with skills in
acquiring, analysing, communicating, and making responsible decisions
from geospatial data. **Our partners** include the National Oceanography
Centre (NOC) who aim to accelerate fundamental ocean science with AI;
Ordnance Survey (OS) who wish to use AI to make new data products and
up-to-date & informative maps; insurance companies in the actuarial
sector interested in modelling and managing risk; and sensor
manufacturers wanting to incorporate AI into next-generation products.
**Our** **target** is to have 40 partners with at least £8m support
(£2.8m cash) from a diverse range of institutions and sectors. **We
already** have 16 partners offering ~£2.3m (£1.3m cash) support, inc. 13
studentships @ 50%. Engagement with further potential partners (inc.
DSTL, Thales, RBC, [CEFAS](https://www.cefas.co.uk/), etc) is ongoing
and we expect to meet our target comfortably. Our diverse partner
portfolio is essential for the training needed to support the Geospatial
AI future of multiple sectors. Our partners enhance our CDT by (i)
embedding their needs in co-created training, research, and governance;
and (ii) forming a network to disseminate, achieve socioeconomic impact,
and provide graduate career paths across sectors, which in turn allows
us to attract diverse cohorts. To date, engagement and surveys show
strong partner support for our vision, evidence cross-sector need for
Geospatial AI experts, and shape our training with contributions of
funded internships, 18 PhD topics, 13 lectures and 6 Grand Challenges.

**We are uniquely placed to deliver this CDT** because we have
supervisors across five faculties, with collective world-leading
expertise across our four themes and a strong track record of industry
collaboration, and who are brought together by our unique hub,
[*Southampton
Geospatial*](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/research/institutes-centres/southampton-geospatial).
We are co-located with our strategic partners, the NOC, OS and the
Office for National Statistics, who are some of the biggest generators,
distributors, and consumers of geospatial data in the UK.

## 2. Student Training Experience

<img src="/assets/images/outline-cfs/image2.png" style="width:8in; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" />

Students enter a four-year PhD programme with *enhanced training
embedded in assessed taught components*. Training requirements must be
met for progression. Projects, supervisory teams and students will be
selected to ensure diversity and coverage of all four themes within each
year group. This overarching cohort and project design are essential to
building the *big-picture* understanding and skills needed to
communicate with wide-ranging expertise through regular peer
interaction. We encourage interaction across year groups through
**cohort-wide** activities that embed multidisciplinary skills. We will
invite CDT alumni to be involved in training and mentoring activities
with the other year groups. These cohort activities will be combined
with specialised individual training plans *tailored to address
individual needs*. The latter being identified by students and
supervisors from a range of training courses organised by the CDT. **Our
training structure** consists of three distinct elements, with
assessment in modules and at the annual progression review: (i)
subject-specific training, (ii) research and enterprise skills training
and (iii) research in practice training. Partner co-developed content
ensures graduates with diverse backgrounds will be equipped to address
skills gaps. Training is across all years so students can reflect and
experiment putting lessons into practice as their projects and networks
develop.

**Subject-specific:** We will recruit students with wide-ranging prior
knowledge of Geospatial science and/or AI. Three compulsory Y1
foundation modules developed for this CDT will bring students to the
same level: *Foundations of Geospatial Science*, *Foundations of AI*,
and *Foundations of Geospatial AI*. Further optional modules (identified
with supervisors through individual training plans) will develop either
subject-specific or software and data skills. Optional modules will be
selected from an existing 100+ module catalogue covering both
theoretical and applied aspects of Geospatial AI. Y2 and Y3 students
will take at least one subject-specific training module either offered
at UoS from existing courses, national training centres, and partners
including [NCRM](https://www.ncrm.ac.uk/) and
[SEPnet](https://www.sepnet.ac.uk/). Training in the use of IRIDIS, our
HPC facility, will be provided in conjunction with our HPC team and
identified national service providers such as ARCHER2/DIRAC and the
Hartree Centre. Additional training on advanced topics will be developed
and offered to our partners, wider industry, and other CDTs.

**Research and Enterprise skills**: Our Researcher Development Programme
(RDP) and a novel *Graduate Research Workshop* (GRW) module develop
these skills. **RDP**: Supervisors and students assess generic skills
training needs and identify at least 2 modules each year through the
University’s existing centres such as the Centre for Higher Education
Practice (CHEP), Public Engagement with Research unit (PERu), Public
Policy at Southampton, Software Sustainability Institute and
FutureWorlds. These cover generic research skills, academic writing,
publishing, knowledge exchange, public engagement, software & data
carpentry, and translation & impact. **GRW**: We will develop a new
module (24 sessions/yr) which will address research and enterprise
training needs that are not covered by RDP, with bespoke interactive
workshops and networking events to cover technical and technological
application aspects of Geospatial AI and facilitate peer-to-peer
learning and interactions both within and across year groups. Repetition
is avoided through a 3-year rolling programme, focusing on application
(Y1), commercialisation (Y2), and entrepreneurship (Y3). Participation
is compulsory and assessed, with students maintaining a learning diary.
As part of GRW, students organise an annual conference to present their
research to internal and external audiences. GRW will be offered to
other doctoral students to facilitate idea cross-pollination. GRW
contains induction activities for incoming students with training on
responsible innovation, project design, engagement, and sustainability.

**Research in Practice** is achieved through (i) Grand Challenges (GCs)
and (ii) internships and (iii) public engagement. **GCs:** The annual GC
event will be a key training activity to strengthen cohort building and
develop generic skills needed to bridge theory and practice. Our GCs are
perfect examples of the AI Roadmap’s “moonshots”<sup>7</sup>, driven by
a policy and/or industry need and will be led by external partners.
Teams of 4-6 PhD students will address a specific GC over a 1-week
period using Geospatial AI techniques whilst demonstrating responsible
innovation by considering potential consequences, questions, and ethical
and social facets. During the initial CDT year, teams will be mentored
by academics and partners. As we progress through the CDT, Y3 and Y4
students will be mentors. **Internships:** Each student is required to
take up internship opportunities, which include being embedded at their
research project’s external sponsor, taking part in generic internships
offered by partners (e.g., ESA, OS, NOC, CERN) and leading international
institutions (e.g., MIT, IITs, AIMS), for a period of up to 3 months
during their candidature. **Public engagement:** students will receive
training on public engagement from the PERu training facility and will
engage in at least two outreach activities involving active
participation in public education around the risks and rewards of AI and
data. **Cohort EDI:** Two studentships/yr will be reserved for students
with non-traditional backgrounds. Additional bursaries will flexibly
support student circumstances as required. Pre-application internships
and project co-creation/supervisor matching workshops will increase
exposure to candidates with non-traditional backgrounds and lower
engagement barriers.

## 3. Centre Management and Pastoral Care

<img src="/assets/images/outline-cfs/image3.png"
style="width:8in; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" />

Our team is built on diverse skills needed to deliver this highly
interdisciplinary proposal, with experienced members to ensure
successful initial programme delivery, and succession planning for the
team to evolve during the CDT lifecycle with junior colleagues stepping
up as they gain experience. **Director JH** is an expert in ML with
publications in top venues (e.g., prestigious NeurIPS and ICLR papers),
with collaborations in Geospatial AI across the University. His
\>15-year collaboration with OS has funded PhDs & projects, resulting in
publications in top journals on using ML with geospatial data, a joint
patent<sup>8</sup> and transformative business changes at
OS<sup>9</sup>. The management committee (MC) offers leadership ability,
experience in developing successful postgraduate training, successful
PhD supervision, quantifiable academic excellence in the four CDT
themes, and comprehensive relationships with industry. Highlights:
**JH** is Deputy Head of School (DHoS) Education and former Director of
both UG and PhD programmes; **MT** is Head of School, previously DHoS
Research, and member of the UoA10 REF panel; **JD** is founder of
Southampton Geospatial, co-chair of the ESRC IAA and a former DHoS
Research, faculty Director of Enterprise, and MSc Programme lead; **BT**
co-directs the In Situ and Remote Intelligent Sensing centre and was
EPSRC Fellow for Marine Robotics and AI, with established collaboration
with the NOC in EPSRC and NERC remits; **JSJ** is CEO of the National
Biofilms Innovation Centre and former Associate Dean. Collectively they
have supervised \>50 PhDs to completion. **Subcommittees** on student
admissions and progression (AP); taught training (TT); recruitment,
outreach and widening participation (ROWP); business engagement (BE);
impact and research themes will report to the management committee
(IRT). Each of the four CDT themes has an aligned IRT lead. ROWP is led
by an experienced outreach manager and EDI champion who will manage
outreach and public engagement, develop and monitor recruitment, and
support mechanisms to embed EDI in our cohorts, supervisor pool,
management, and operations. AP supports students using evidence-based
approaches such as mentoring and coaching and provides pastoral care
aided by central university support. Each subcommittee will be
coordinated by a member of the management committee, working with
academic and support staff across the CDT. Students and partners will be
on subcommittees, enabling contributions throughout. BE is led by
existing managers with large portfolios of connections. An advisory
board will guide the CDT and a dedicated manager will lead operations,
overseeing support throughout. The CDT follows university good
practices, including having at least two supervisors per student and
mandatory EDI training for staff and students. Our initial engagement
has identified a pool of 56 potential supervisors (30% ECR, 34% female)
across all faculties and CDT themes to work alongside co-supervisors
from partner organisations. We aim to achieve a supervisor profile with
50% ECR and 50% female within the first 3 years of the CDT with help
from our institutional EDI working group and strategy<sup>10</sup>.
