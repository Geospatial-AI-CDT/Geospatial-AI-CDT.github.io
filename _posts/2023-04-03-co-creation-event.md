Whilst we wait for the outcome of the EoI and to find out if we'll be invited to sumbit a full proposal we're busy planning an industry engagement event for the 22nd of May. Irrespective of the outcome of the EoI, this event will be a great opportunity to discuss the requirements that industry, NGOs and charities working with geospatial data have with respect to finding skilled people that can process geospatial data with AI and ML technologies. 

The hybrid event will consist of a mixture of short talks and and discussion sessions, including a panel session with a number of guests looking at what the current skills gaps are, and how we should try to fill them. We're excited to confirm that Nigel Clifford from the [Geospatial Commission](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/geospatial-commission) will chair the panel, and that panellists will include [Iris Kramer](https://www.forbes.com/profile/iris-kramer/), a former Southampton student and founder of [ArchAI](https://archai.io).

More information can be found on the [Eventbright page](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/geospatial-ai-a-future-pipeline-of-geospatial-leaders-tickets-607431874087), where it is possible to register for attendance in person or remotely.
